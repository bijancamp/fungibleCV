fungibleCV
==========
Simulation that assesses the cross-validation performance of fungible weights.

#### Description
See comments in fungibleCV.R for details.

#### Usage
`fungibleCV()`

#### Value
Table containing cross-validation metrics for simulated data. See fungibleCV.R for details.

#### Requirements
In addition to the libraries sourced in fungibleCV.R, this simulation requires the `fungibleR` function for producing correlation matrices (Waller, 2013, under review) and the `Fungible` function for producing alternate weights that share a common ùëÖ¬≤ value (Waller, 2008).
